# Annoying Popup

A Discord bot that learns from user messages using Markov Chains! Uses Cleverbot functions if `--full-sentience` is appended to a message (or if user is DMd)

**NOTE:** A lot of this code is still messy. I am working on making it more pretty overtime :)

**NOTE:** Most of the channel IDs are hard coded into the bot. This will be changed in the future!
